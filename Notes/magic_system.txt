Magic System

	Each character is assigned an element at the start and it cannot be changed. Charaters gain magic abilties by gaining experience in a magical class.

	There are pure magic classes where characters learn the prime forms of the magic.

	There are hybrid classes that translate magic learned in the pure magic classes that apply to their class ablities. This magic must first be learned form their pure magic class.

Magic is broken down into 4 different catagories: 

Elemental Magic
