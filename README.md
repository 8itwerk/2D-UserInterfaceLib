# GameUI
An exploration in 2D user interfaces using SFML

This set of classes is meant to be an extension to SFML to support user interface creation. In the current form the client will create elements that can be drawn to the screen by passing in an SFML render window. The element is an ABC and from it is derived a handful of useful types provided for creating user interfaces. The client may also derive their own element types to extend the capabilities to more specific needs.
